# This project is under construction :)

If you're willing to help, you can contact me here at GitHub via the [contribute issue](https://github.com/atempel/projectgen/issues/1).

## Quick introduction
The idea behind this project is to create a generator that helps people take their attention or mind load out of thinking what to design/code for practice or portfolio, and put it in the work itself.
### Example
One of the first milestones is being able to return the industry and features for the project. Like: "a **food** company that **deliveries throught bicicles**" would be a project generated, and people would be able to apply that to their project, making a website, or a UI, or design the logistics, etc.

Thanks for reading all that! :D
