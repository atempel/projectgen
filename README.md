# This project is under construction :)

If you're willing to help, you can contact me here at GitHub via the [contribute issue](https://github.com/atempel/projectgen/issues/1).

## Quick introduction
The idea behind this project is to create a generator that helps people take their attention or mind load out of thinking what to design/code for practice or portfolio, and put it in the work itself.
### Example
One of the first milestones is being able to return the industry and features for the project. Like: "a **food** company that **deliveries throught bicicles**" would be a project generated, and people would be able to apply that to their project, making a website, or a UI, or design the logistics, etc.
This project is also a personal project of mine, so I can exercise and learn new tecnologies, so keep that in mind.

## Tecnologies
I'm using [Bulma](https://bulma.io/) as the CSS framework, and [Vue](https://vuejs.org/) to build the algorithm behind the generator and deal with the "database", [Fontawesome](https://fontawesome.com/) for the icons and I'm trying to see if [Buefy](https://buefy.github.io/) is worth trying. 
**NPM** is the package manager and I'm also using [Browsersync](https://www.browsersync.io) to help in the development.
Apart from that there's nothing major to consider.

Thanks for reading all that! :D
